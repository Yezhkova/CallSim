Simplified Mobile Network Simulator Prototype

Overview

This project is a prototype simulator of a simplified mobile network, demonstrating core network functionalities such as subscriber registration and call handling between subscribers. It uses modern C++ tooling and libraries to simulate interactions in a minimalistic environment.
Tools & Technologies Used

    C++ — Core language for logic and systems implementation

    CMake — Build system and project configuration

    Protobuf — Data serialization for communication between components

    Boost.Asio — Asynchronous I/O for client-server interaction

    GTest — Unit testing framework

    Finite State Machine — Models the call states and transitions

    IPC (Interprocess Communication) — Simulates real-world communication paths

    Concurrency-free jobs — Simplifies parallel logic to avoid race conditions
